# WhatsApp-Chat-Analyzer
Developed a whatsapp chat analysis system which takes a text document exported from whatsapp as input and  provides detailed analysis with respect to overall group as well as each individual. Analysis include statistics of  messages, media and links shared, monthly timeline of number of messages, activity maps with respect to days  and months, most active users and their contribution of messages, emoji analysis, wordcloud and hourly activity  map. Web API is created using Streamlit, deployed and running live on Heroku. Live project link: https://whatsapp-chat-analyzer-rp.herokuapp.com
